      "body": "Because of this type of project and the timeline. The design iteration was not a focus. We decided to find a framework online and adapt an already existing theme design. Most people would be using their phone to access the site so the design needs to accommodate that. Communication would be only set in the initial request and users first response. We would not have CI/CD live messaging. Location services would need to have access to your location so a request would need to be made to the device you are using. For Map integration we would keep it simple and only use Google Maps and affiliate API’s. "

We used a combination of Materialize CSS and custom CSS to quickly pump out the design. Invitations to the site user session were sent via text message or email. Accounts and guest accounts were set up for quick access or history of places. We used Google Business API and Google Location (lat long) to find people’s locations, store them and then wrote an algorythm to estimate the central location between them. Then Google would search from their Business API for an establishment with our requirements."

Also, experiences will differ from phone to phone. More testing was needed to have a more standardized experience. A recommendation would be to use something like Storybook for UI consistancy."
